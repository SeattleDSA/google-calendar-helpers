Access Wednesdays run on the second and third Wednesday each month in 2017 from 6:30pm to 8:30pm.\n\nThe Underground Studio Access Pass is your way to access The Underground Studio's materials and resources. For a yearly fee of $150 you gain access to twelve unique workshops that are intended to expose children to a wide variety of methods of making.

Simply let us know your name, how many children will be attending and their names & ages, and the date of the workshop(s) you would like to attend. Each session costs $14+ HST or for a savings of $18 you can purchase an Access Pass. Walk-in registrations on the day of the workshop are not guaranteed due to space availability and supplies.\n\nLevel Up: Toy Hacking - December 14/2016\nOur Underground Studio will be turned into an island of misfit toys for the month of December.

However, they are also very useful due to their small size and the very large specific surface areas.  A nanotechnology has been developed that can significantly enhance fine particle flowability by coating a small fraction of nano particles onto their surfaces.\n\nUsing this technology, the speaker's research group has been able to develop a few technologies including an ultrafine powder coating technology, a pulmonary drug delivery technology and a novel powder coating technology for pharmaceutical tablets, some of which have been commercialized or are being commercialized.  This talk will review some of the stories behind the technological development and reveal some critical details of the technologies.\n\nBio-sketch:\nDr. Jesse Zhu is a Distinguished University Professor and Canada Research Chair in the Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Western University.  He received his PhD from the University of British Columbia and also worked for Shell before joining Western in 1993.  In 1999, he established the Particle Technology Research Centre and has served as its Director since then.  He is a Fellow of Royal Society of Canada and has received many awards including the highest career award from the Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering and the highest research award from Western University. \n\nDr. Zhu has many years of experience in the research area of powder handling, fluidized bed and multi-phase flow systems.  With 400+ publications, 20+ patents, and over 150 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows supervised, he has worked on a very wide range of R&D projects, many from the industry.  In addition to fundamental research, he is particularly active in technology development and transfer, with several inventions commercialized or being commercialized.\n\nLocation \nE6-2024\nCanada",

For assorted reasons it is not viable for Computer Recycling to spend much time refurbishing these laptops itself, so we sort through them, select ones in reasonable condition, then install Xubuntu on them for resale.\n\nYou are invited to come help! You do not need to be a Linux nerd or a hardware genius to participate: if you can use a screwdriver, read numbers and follow instructions then you can be helpful. There will be lots to learn, but you can learn it as you go along. Linux nerds and hardware geniuses are also welcome to participate, of course.\n\nTo participate, please RSVP using the Contact Us functionality on this website: http://kwlug.org/contact  Because Computer Recycling is ordinarily closed on Saturdays, you will need special instructions to get into the building.\n\nWe will start at around 4pm and end around 8pm, but if you can only come later or have to leave earlier that's fine too.",

Build snapping alligators, race cars, and spinning robots, then program them with the WeDo visual drag-and-drop programming software.\nIn this kids robotics course, students are taught engineering basics with an emphasis on exploration and trial and error field-testing. Instead of simply \u201csnapping bricks together,\u201d students are encouraged to think critically about how and why their design needs to adapt to changing conditions. Our guided, personalized instruction allows younger kids to understand more complicated engineering techniques such as gear use, pulleys, and inclined planes.\n\nLEGO Mindstorm EV3:\nDesign awesome machines with the LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Base Set and Software. Using visual drag-and-drop programming software, build a drag racer that speeds up as you cheer louder or a guard robot that growls at nearby intruders.\nIn this class, students experiment and discover engineering basics via trial and error field testing. Rather than just \u201csnapping bricks together,\u201d students learn critical thinking skills and modify their robot designs based on varying conditions. The course exposes students to more complex engineering techniques such as pulleys, inclined planes, and gear use. Let\u2019s get building!\nwww.stemotics.com\n",

Some clinics work on a walk-in basis, but most work with scheduled appointments. Variation in the duration of consultations, random no-shows and walk-ins, and other sources of variability and uncertainty result in waiting time for patients and idle time for the clinician. The challenge, then, is to determine appointment schedules that achieve the best-possible synchronization of the patient\u2019s arrival with the availability of the clinician despite this variability in the process.\n\n1. Mathematical optimization\n\nThere is a large body of research in OR that designs procedures for computing schedules that strike a good balance between expected waiting time for patients and idle time for the clinician. Determining expectations of the waiting and idle time is, in general, analytically intractable, and the challenge is to find effective approximation and simplification techniques. We developed an approach where we approximate the service times by phase-type distributions. These approximate realistic distributions well, and in addition, their properties allow a recursive algorithm to determine the expected waiting and idle times analytically. Standard optimization techniques can be used to compute near-optimal schedules from there.\n\nNext, we show how the approach can be extended in an elegantly simple manner to incorporate no-shows and walk-ins. The procedure outperforms simpler approximations almost uniformly in its precision, and it outperforms approaches based on simulation vastly in computation time and ease of use.\n\n2. Multiple-case study\n\nThe way in which the problem of appointment scheduling is usually framed in mathematical optimization approaches has very meager substantiation, neither from theory in operations management, nor from field studies analyzing the objectives and challenges in real healthcare operations. We conducted a multiple-case study, conducted in 10 clinics, aimed at two research questions:\n\n   What is the structure of the problem of appointment scheduling in outpatient clinics?\n   What are current practices and underlying assumptions and conceptualizations in the field?\n\nBased on the results, we propose that there are better ways to address the problem than scheduling, and these reflect modern approaches for production management in industry. Rather than absorbing the effects of variability in buffers of waiting and idle time, it is better to pursue that variability is reduced, and to absorb the remaining variability by flexibility of clinicians and other resources. Moreover, given the complexity and dynamic behavior of service processes in outpatient clinics, we recommend optimization approaches based on feedback adjustment, instead of the currently studied approaches based on optimal design.\n\nLocation \nM3 - Mathematics 3\nRoom 3127\n200 University Avenue West\nWaterloo, ON N2L 3G1\nCanada",

Why do people find delight in completing complex functions on their smartphone? Why has mobile set the bar for delightful user experiences? Enter microinteractions.\n\nMicrointeractions are single use interactions such as:\n- Setting an alarm\n- Changing your home's temperature\n- Liking a post on Facebook\n\nThey go un-noticed until something goes horribly wrong (as does all good design); Microinteractions set the foundation for delight and usability in web applications, mobile apps, and even household appliances.\n\nWe're going to review the key ingredients of micro interactions. I'll share some examples of successful microinteractions and how they've shaped the products they live in. We'll discuss process and how you can include micro interactions in your workflow.\n\nBob Duncan is a passionate Product Designer located in sunny Winnipeg Canada.\n\nWith more than ten years designing for the digital world, he takes pride in simplifying complex problems to create intuitive, beautiful user experiences. \n\nBob is confident designing web and mobile applications. As a user centered designer, he enjoys quick iteration loops with users to validate his problem hypothesis and design solutions.\n\nIn addition to crafting design solutions, Bob is passionate about growing the design community in Winnipeg and beyond. He is the founder of the Interaction Design Association of Winnipeg and teaches User Experience part time.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin us at D2L at 151 Charles St West in the Tannery on Monday, April 24 from 6:30 to 8:30pm. Take the elevator to the 3rd floor where a D2Ler will greet you. This is a free event that is open to the public. RSVP today on Meetup.\n\nFree parking is available in the Tannery parking lot. We will have local craft beer and snacks available.\n\n",

I will focus on efforts that leverage learning and inference to help people with decisions, covering work in transportation, healthcare, and interactive systems.  I will present projects that draw from traditional sources of data, such as GPS signals and electronic health records, as well as efforts that harness more exotic streams of information, including the use of planes in flight and anonymized behavioral data drawn from web services. I will conclude by discussing the promise of leveraging data, learning, and reasoning to enable new kinds of collaboration between people and machines to address challenges in the sciences, society, and daily life.\n\nBiography:\n\nEric Horvitz is a technical fellow and director of the Microsoft Research lab at Redmond.  He has pursued principles and applications of artificial intelligence, with contributions in decisions under uncertainty, machine learning, bounded rationality, information retrieval, and human computation.  His research and collaborations have led to fielded systems in healthcare, transportation, human-computer interaction, operating systems, ecommerce, and robotics.  He has been elected fellow of the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Association for the Advancement of AI (AAAI), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the Association for Computing Machinery.  He received the Feigenbaum Prize and the ACM-AAAI Allen Newell Award for his research contributions.  He has served as president of the AAAI, chair of the AAAS Section on Information, Computing, and Communications, and on advisory committees for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, DARPA, and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.

A. Drabold\n\u200bDistinguished Professor\nDepartment of Physics & Astronomy, Ohio University\n\nDavid Alan Drabold works on the theory of condensed matter. His work has focused particularly on the physics of amorphous materials, including glasses. In addition to creating realistic computer models of these materials, he has contributed significantly to our understanding of the consequences of structural disorder to electronic, optical and transport properties. He has also developed a number of new computational algorithms for the efficient and accurate simulation of these and other materials using approaches based upon the foundation of quantum mechanics.\n\n\ufffcABSTRACT\nConventional modeling of complex materials usually proceeds by some form of direct atomistic simulation, such at Monte Carlo or Molecular Dynamics, which is often intended to mimic an experimental growth process. In such a simulation, no use is made of a priori  information. Often, we possess information from experiments about the materials, or we may wish to design a novel material with a desired property. In this talk, I discuss strategies to build in experimental data as a constraint in the modeling[1], and also a scheme to impose optical properties (say, opening or closing the optical gap [2]). The latter method has made it possible to create electronically designed phases of amorphous carbon and silicon using tight-binding molecular dynamics, and with extension to ab initio schemes, to discover the conducting phase of a silver-doped chalcogenide \u201cConducting Bridge\u201d FLASH memory material[3].\n\nReferences\n[1] A.

Build snapping alligators, race cars, and spinning robots, then program them with the WeDo visual drag-and-drop programming software.\nIn this kids robotics course, students are taught engineering basics with an emphasis on exploration and trial and error field-testing. Instead of simply \u201csnapping bricks together,\u201d students are encouraged to think critically about how and why their design needs to adapt to changing conditions. Our guided, personalized instruction allows younger kids to understand more complicated engineering techniques such as gear use, pulleys, and inclined planes.\n\nLEGO Mindstorm EV3:\nDesign awesome machines with the LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Base Set and Software. Using visual drag-and-drop programming software, build a drag racer that speeds up as you cheer louder or a guard robot that growls at nearby intruders.\nIn this class, students experiment and discover engineering basics via trial and error field testing. Rather than just \u201csnapping bricks together,\u201d students learn critical thinking skills and modify their robot designs based on varying conditions. The course exposes students to more complex engineering techniques such as pulleys, inclined planes, and gear use. Let\u2019s get building!\nwww.stemotics.com\n",

We meet in Kitchener, Ontario, usually on the first (non-holiday) Monday of the month. Our meetings are free and open to those with an interest in Linux. Find out more about our meetings. Join our mailing lists.\n\n    Setup/pre-meeting: 6pm\n    Formal meeting start: 7pm\n    Post meeting: 9pm\n\nThe pre-meeting is informal and very loosely structured. This is an opportunity form small group discussions. At times we may have a brief video presentation as well. Informal question and answer sessions regarding your specific projects are welcome.\n\nThe formal part of the meeting is not really very formal at all; we have no requirement for tuxedoes or evening wear. But we do try to give informative presentations during the formal meeting. This will include a few technical presentations by our members. The topics are as varied as our members and have included everything from games to finance, from graphics to file systems, databases to word processors, from spam filtering to telephone answering machines from servers to clients, from hither to yon. If you find any of this confusing, don't worry, we have question and answer sessions too!\n\nAfter the meeting and a quick clean-up, some of us will go to a local restaurant for further discussion and snacks. Make sure to ask us for details if you plan to join us.\n\nMeetings are free and open to those with an interest in Linux. All levels of Linux experience are welcome at our meetings. You are welcome if you have heard about Linux and are curious to learn more. Come on out and meet us. See our locations page to find out where to go.",

Build snapping alligators, race cars, and spinning robots, then program them with the WeDo visual drag-and-drop programming software.\nIn this kids robotics course, students are taught engineering basics with an emphasis on exploration and trial and error field-testing. Instead of simply \u201csnapping bricks together,\u201d students are encouraged to think critically about how and why their design needs to adapt to changing conditions. Our guided, personalized instruction allows younger kids to understand more complicated engineering techniques such as gear use, pulleys, and inclined planes.\n\nLEGO Mindstorm EV3:\nDesign awesome machines with the LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Base Set and Software. Using visual drag-and-drop programming software, build a drag racer that speeds up as you cheer louder or a guard robot that growls at nearby intruders.\nIn this class, students experiment and discover engineering basics via trial and error field testing. Rather than just \u201csnapping bricks together,\u201d students learn critical thinking skills and modify their robot designs based on varying conditions. The course exposes students to more complex engineering techniques such as pulleys, inclined planes, and gear use. Let\u2019s get building!\nwww.stemotics.com\n",

The purpose of this conference is to explore the spectrum of pathways of academic success in STEM with an explicit focus on gender equity and its intersections with other identity markers.\n\nHighlights include:\n\n    Keynotes by Dr. Lesley Yellowlees, University of Edinburgh and Dr. Lesley Shannon, Simon Fraser University\n    Workshops on strategic networking, academic interviewing, and work-life balance\n    Presentation by Ontario\u2019s Pay Equity Commissioner on salary negotiation\n\nAre you a graduate student, postdoc or young scholar considering an academic career in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) field? Join us to explore the spectrum of pathways of academic success in STEM with an explicit focus on gender equity and its intersections with other identity markers.\n\nNetwork with like-minded scholars to form supportive academic communities and connections with academic mentors. Sessions will focus on issues related to the under-representation of women-identifying aspiring scholars in the STEM fields, associated challenges in academia and identification of potential practical solutions and career advice for women.\n\nParticipation is open to all genders. Everyone interested in these issues is welcome to attend.

In recent years, atypically warm water layers have been observed at depth in the Arctic Ocean. These derive from intense summertime solar heating in expansive ice-free regions. Heat that is stored in the shallow ocean can be released in the fall and winter by shear-driven mixing, and convective mixing by the release of dense plumes during sea-ice growth, reducing the net sea-ice growth. On the other hand, deeper warm ocean layers remain unaffected. I'll show that under continued warming, there exists the possibility for a regime shift in ocean ventilation by these warm waters, and a subsequent cap on the storage of deep-ocean heat. \n",

      "description": "<a href='http://tinkertruck.ca/maker-club-cambridge/'>http://tinkertruck.ca/maker-club-cambridge/</a>\nTinker Truck\nMaker Club Cambridge!\n\nNEWS! Our newest Maker Club started up in Cambridge at PlayFit Kids Club in 2017. Building on the experience and strengths of the Kitchener club at THEMUSEUM we\u2019ve decided to expand the availability to a wider audience and a new city. You can find the details below or sign up for our newsletter to keep informed.\n\nIn general, the goal of MakerClub is to explore creativity using tools that children often do not get to play with. We use saws, glue guns, hammers and soldering irons to make something interesting each month. In the process we teach our kids how to work with these tools safely and respectfully. Parents are required to stay, learn, and participate in the program so that they can foster inventiveness and makerly explorations at home between meetings. We require at least one adult per two children for new maker club members. As the month\u2019s pass and skills grow we can discuss relaxing this ratio on an individual basis.\n\nUpcoming Maker Club meetings in Cambridge:\n\nThursday, February 9th \u2013 6:30-8pm \u2013 Toy Hacking\nThursday, March 9th \u2013 6:30-8pm \u2013 LED Artwork\nThursday, April 13th \u2013 6:30-8pm \u2013 Make your own TShirt\nThursday, May 11th \u2013 6:30-8pm \u2013 LED Slingshot Helicopters (bring outdoor clothes)\nThursday, June 8th  \u2013 6:30-8pm \u2013 Foam Air Rockets\nThursday, July 13th  \u2013 6:30-8pm \u2013 Portable River Experiments\nThursday, August 10th  \u2013 6:30-8pm \u2013 Marshmallow Mayhem\nThursday, September 14th  \u2013 6:30-8pm \u2013 3D Printing and Modelling (bring your own Laptop)\nOctober, November and December topics to be selected by regular participants.\nThe cost for this program is $20/child per evening. Parents are free. Indoor Playground time is available and included in this price starting at 5pm (bring a second adult and siblings in the playground are $5+tax all night). A quarterly Maker Club Cambridge membership is available for $50 for three (3) consecutive months if paid before your first month.\n\nThere is a limit of 20 children per class, so please be sure to book in advance.",

Build snapping alligators, race cars, and spinning robots, then program them with the WeDo visual drag-and-drop programming software.\nIn this kids robotics course, students are taught engineering basics with an emphasis on exploration and trial and error field-testing. Instead of simply \u201csnapping bricks together,\u201d students are encouraged to think critically about how and why their design needs to adapt to changing conditions. Our guided, personalized instruction allows younger kids to understand more complicated engineering techniques such as gear use, pulleys, and inclined planes.\n\nLEGO Mindstorm EV3:\nDesign awesome machines with the LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Base Set and Software. Using visual drag-and-drop programming software, build a drag racer that speeds up as you cheer louder or a guard robot that growls at nearby intruders.\nIn this class, students experiment and discover engineering basics via trial and error field testing. Rather than just \u201csnapping bricks together,\u201d students learn critical thinking skills and modify their robot designs based on varying conditions. The course exposes students to more complex engineering techniques such as pulleys, inclined planes, and gear use. Let\u2019s get building!\nwww.stemotics.com\n",

Safely.\n\nUsing saws, glue guns, hammers and soldering irons, families will explore creativity with tools often reserved for adults. Access Wednesdays run on the second and third Wednesday each month in 2017 from 6:30pm to 8:30pm.\n\nThe Underground Studio Access Pass is your way to access The Underground Studio's materials and resources. For a yearly fee of $150 you gain access to twelve unique workshops that are intended to expose children to a wide variety of methods of making. You also receive exclusive discounts to our Underground Studio Camps and Weekend Workshop programs, along with additional access to the space to use items such as our 3D printers.\n\nInterested in trying an Access Wednesday without an Access Pass? Attend a drop-in workshop to try it out! Please pre-register with us at least 7 days prior by sending an email to UndergroundStudio@THEMUSEUM.ca with the subject line Access Wednesdays. Simply let us know your name, how many children will be attending and their names & ages, and the date of the workshop(s) you would like to attend. Each session costs $14+ HST or for a savings of $18 you can purchase an Access Pass. Walk-in registrations on the day of the workshop are not guaranteed due to space availability and supplies.\n\nLevel Up: Toy Hacking - December 14/2016\nOur Underground Studio will be turned into an island of misfit toys for the month of December. With love, attention, and ingenuity, these toys can be repurposed to create new happy memories. Learn how to deconstruct devices and reconstruct them again in this open-ended experience\n\nLevel Up: T-Shirt Silkscreening - January 11/2017\nInk yourself, or rather, fabrics that you own, in this hands-on workshop that introduces the principles of silkscreening.

When an external source of heat is applied, the fluid contained expands and pushes a cylinder, driving a flywheel. The air then cools and pushes the cylinder back downward, allowing the process to repeat. We will build a very simple Stirling engine using commonly found household items.\n\nLevel Up: Stirling Engine - March 15/2017\nStirling Engines are heat-powered engines that operate within a closed-system.

Build snapping alligators, race cars, and spinning robots, then program them with the WeDo visual drag-and-drop programming software.\nIn this kids robotics course, students are taught engineering basics with an emphasis on exploration and trial and error field-testing. Instead of simply \u201csnapping bricks together,\u201d students are encouraged to think critically about how and why their design needs to adapt to changing conditions. Our guided, personalized instruction allows younger kids to understand more complicated engineering techniques such as gear use, pulleys, and inclined planes.\n\nLEGO Mindstorm EV3:\nDesign awesome machines with the LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Base Set and Software. Using visual drag-and-drop programming software, build a drag racer that speeds up as you cheer louder or a guard robot that growls at nearby intruders.\nIn this class, students experiment and discover engineering basics via trial and error field testing. Rather than just \u201csnapping bricks together,\u201d students learn critical thinking skills and modify their robot designs based on varying conditions. The course exposes students to more complex engineering techniques such as pulleys, inclined planes, and gear use. Let\u2019s get building!\nwww.stemotics.com\n",
